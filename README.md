## About this solution

This is a minimalist, non-layered startup solution with the ABP Framework. All the fundamental ABP modules are already installed.

## How to run

The application needs to connect to a database. Run the following command in the `ToolMan` directory:

````bash
dotnet run --migrate-database
````

This will create and seed the initial database. Then you can run the application with any IDE that supports .NET.

Happy coding..!
